## Generations

The Kia Optima has gone through several generations, each bringing significant improvements and changes:

- **First Generation (2000-2005)**: The original Optima was based on the Hyundai Sonata platform, offering both 2.4L 4-cylinder and 2.5L V6 engines. It was Kia's first midsize sedan entry into many markets, establishing the brand in the segment.

- **Second Generation (2005-2010)**: This generation brought a complete redesign with more distinctive styling and improved build quality. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 and a 2.7L V6, with both manual and automatic transmission options available.

- **Third Generation (2010-2015)**: A revolutionary redesign that transformed the Optima's image with Peter Schreyer's "Tiger Nose" design language. This generation offered 2.4L GDI and 2.0L turbocharged engines, plus a hybrid variant introduced in 2011. It marked a significant leap in styling, technology, and performance.

- **Fourth Generation (2016-2020)**: Built on the success of its predecessor, this generation featured refined styling, improved ride quality, and advanced safety features. Engine options included a 2.4L GDI, 2.0L turbo, and an updated hybrid system, along with a new plug-in hybrid variant.

- **Fifth Generation (2020-2023)**: Known as the K5 in some markets, this generation represented the final iteration of the Optima nameplate. It featured bold styling, standard turbocharged engines, and available all-wheel drive. The base engine was a 1.6L turbo, with an optional 2.5L turbocharged engine producing 290 hp in the GT model.
